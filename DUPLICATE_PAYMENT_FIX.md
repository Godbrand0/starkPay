# Duplicate Payment Records - Issue & Fix

## Problem Description

When merchants created a QR code for payment, a "pending" payment record was created in the database. When users scanned and paid, the system sometimes created a **NEW** "completed" payment record instead of updating the existing "pending" one. This resulted in:

- Multiple payment records for the same transaction
- Pending payments remaining in the database indefinitely
- Confusion in transaction history

## Root Cause

The issue was in the payment verification logic ([paymentController.js:157-183](backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js#L157-L183)). When verifying a blockchain transaction, the system would:

1. Try to find an existing "pending" payment by matching:
   - Merchant address
   - Token address
   - Amount

2. If no exact match was found, create a NEW payment record

**The matching was failing because:**
- Amount formatting differences (e.g., "1" vs "1.0" vs "1.00")
- Slight timing issues
- The search was too strict and didn't account for variations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Matching Logic

Updated `verifyTransaction` function with a **3-tier matching strategy**:

#### **Strategy 1: Exact Match**
```javascript
payment = await Payment.findOne({
  merchantAddress,
  tokenAddress,
  amount: grossAmountDecimal,
  status: { $in: ['pending', 'processing', 'expired'] }
}).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

#### **Strategy 2: Amount Variations**
Try multiple amount formats to handle formatting differences:
```javascript
const variations = [
  grossAmountDecimal,
  parseFloat(grossAmountDecimal).toString(),
  parseFloat(grossAmountDecimal).toFixed(1),
  parseFloat(grossAmountDecimal).toFixed(2)
];
```

#### **Strategy 3: Time-Based Proximity Search**
If still no match, find ANY pending payment from the same merchant within 10 minutes with a similar amount (within 0.1% difference):
```javascript
const candidates = await Payment.find({
  merchantAddress,
  tokenAddress,
  status: { $in: ['pending', 'processing', 'expired'] },
  createdAt: { $gte: tenMinutesAgo }
}).sort({ createdAt: -1 });

// Find closest amount match
for (const candidate of candidates) {
  const candidateAmount = parseFloat(candidate.amount);
  if (Math.abs(candidateAmount - amountFloat) / amountFloat < 0.001) {
    payment = candidate;
    break;
  }
}
```

### 2. Automatic Payment Cleanup Service

Created [cleanupService.js](backend/src/services/cleanupService.js) that:

- **Auto-expires pending payments** every 5 minutes if past their expiration time
- **Deletes old expired/failed payments** daily (older than 30 days)
- Keeps the database clean automatically

```javascript
// Auto-expire pending payments every 5 minutes
setInterval(autoExpirePendingPayments, 5 * 60 * 1000);

// Delete old expired/failed payments daily
setInterval(deleteOldPayments, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 3. Manual Cleanup Script

Created [cleanup-old-pending.js](backend/cleanup-old-pending.js) for one-time cleanup:

```bash
cd backend
node cleanup-old-pending.js
```

This script:
- Finds all pending/processing payments
- Marks expired ones as "expired"
- Deletes genuine duplicates (pending payments with matching completed records)

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
1. **[backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js](backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js#L151-L214)**
   - Enhanced payment matching logic with 3-tier strategy
   - Better logging for debugging

2. **[backend/src/server.js](backend/src/server.js#L12,L87)**
   - Added cleanup service startup

### New Files
1. **[backend/src/services/cleanupService.js](backend/src/services/cleanupService.js)**
   - Automatic payment expiration service
   - Old payment deletion service

2. **[backend/cleanup-old-pending.js](backend/cleanup-old-pending.js)**
   - Manual cleanup script for existing duplicates

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
Payment Status Counts:
  pending: 10      ← Stuck pending payments
  completed: 16
  expired: 12
```

### After Fix
```
Payment Status Counts:
  completed: 16    ← Only legitimate payments
  expired: 22      ← Properly expired old QR codes
```

## How It Works Now

### Merchant Flow
1. Merchant generates QR code
2. **"pending"** payment record created with 5-minute expiry
3. Customer scans and pays
4. **Same "pending"** record is updated to **"completed"**
5. No duplicate records created ✅

### Cleanup Flow
1. Every 5 minutes: Auto-expire pending payments past their expiration time
2. Every 24 hours: Delete very old expired/failed payments
3. Database stays clean automatically ✅

## Benefits

✅ **No more duplicate records** - Each payment has exactly one record
✅ **Clean database** - Old pending payments are properly expired
✅ **Better matching** - Handles amount formatting variations
✅ **Automatic cleanup** - No manual intervention needed
✅ **Improved logging** - Easy to debug payment matching issues

## Monitoring

Check payment status distribution:
```bash
cd backend
node -e "
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
require('dotenv').config();
const Payment = require('./src/models/Payment');

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI).then(async () => {
  const stats = await Payment.aggregate([
    { \$group: { _id: '\$status', count: { \$sum: 1 } } },
    { \$sort: { _id: 1 } }
  ]);
  console.log('Payment Status Counts:');
  stats.forEach(s => console.log('  ' + s._id + ':', s.count));
  process.exit(0);
});
"
```

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add payment ID to QR code data for direct matching
- [ ] Implement transaction hash checking during payment creation
- [ ] Add database index on (merchantAddress, tokenAddress, amount, status)
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for payment status monitoring
- [ ] Add alerts for stuck pending payments
