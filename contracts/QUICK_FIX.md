# Quick Fix: Contract Deployment Issue

## Problem
Your wallet address `0x0599afc4179d665be3857415c7ded0d2b4a1f32e4f4e8a142100a9bd61f03aa6` is not deployed on Starknet Sepolia testnet yet.

## Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Deploy Your Existing Wallet (Recommended)

1. **Open your Starknet wallet** (Argent X or Braavos)
2. **Make sure you're on Sepolia testnet**
3. **Get testnet ETH:**
   - Go to: https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/
   - Or: https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth
   - Request testnet ETH for your address

4. **Deploy your wallet by making a transaction:**
   ```
   - Send 0.001 ETH to yourself
   - Or send to any address
   - This will trigger wallet deployment
   ```

5. **Wait for confirmation** (1-2 minutes)

6. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   node check-wallet.js
   ```

7. **Deploy contracts:**
   ```bash
   node deploy.js
   ```

### Option 2: Use an Already Deployed Wallet

If you have another wallet that's already deployed on Sepolia:

1. Get the deployed wallet's address and private key
2. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...new_private_key
   DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x...new_deployed_address
   OWNER_ADDRESS=0x...new_deployed_address
   TREASURY_ADDRESS=0x...new_deployed_address
   ```
3. Run deployment:
   ```bash
   node check-wallet.js  # Verify first
   node deploy.js        # Deploy
   ```

---

### Option 3: Use Mock/Test Deployment (Development Only)

For local testing without deploying:

1. The frontend already has mock data fallback
2. Backend can work with mock merchant registrations
3. Focus on frontend/backend integration first
4. Deploy contracts when ready for real testing

---

## After Successful Deployment

Once your wallet is deployed and contracts are deployed, you'll get:

```
✅ Contract Address: 0x...
✅ Class Hash: 0x...
✅ Deployment info saved to: deployment-info.json
```

Then update:

### Backend `.env`:
```env
PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0x...deployed_contract_address
```

### Frontend `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0x...deployed_contract_address
```

---

## Verification Commands

### Check wallet status:
```bash
node check-wallet.js
```

### Check contract on Starkscan:
```bash
# After deployment
open https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Test backend connection:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3004/api/payment/tokens
```

✅ **Integration:** Redux persist, modular services
⏳ **Contracts:** Waiting for wallet deployment

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Insufficient funds"**
   - Get more testnet ETH from faucet

2. **"Contract not found"**
   - Wallet not deployed yet (follow Option 1 above)

3. **"Invalid private key"**
   - Check private key format (must start with 0x)
   - Ensure no extra spaces or quotes

4. **"Wrong network"**
   - Switch wallet to Sepolia testnet
   - Verify RPC URL in deploy.js
