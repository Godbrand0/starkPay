# Quick Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Fast Track to Deploy

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build Contract
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Setup Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your wallet details:
```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
OWNER_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS  # Can be same as deployer
TREASURY_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS  # Where fees go
```

### Step 4: Deploy!
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## ‚úÖ What Happens During Deployment

1. **Declares** the contract class on Starknet
2. **Deploys** a new contract instance
3. **Whitelists** USDC and USDT tokens
4. **Saves** deployment info to `deployment-info.json`
5. **Updates** `.env` with contract address

## üìã After Deployment

Copy the contract address from the output and update:

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env.local`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```bash
PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
