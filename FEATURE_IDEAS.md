# StrkPay - Unique Feature Ideas 🚀

## 🎯 Priority Features (High Impact, Achievable)

### 1. **Smart Split Payments** 💰
Allow merchants to automatically split payments between multiple wallets.

**Use Cases:**
- Restaurant splitting bill between kitchen staff (60%), servers (30%), management (10%)
- Freelance teams splitting project payments
- Affiliate/referral commission automation

**Implementation:**
```cairo
// Smart contract
struct PaymentSplit {
    recipient: ContractAddress,
    percentage: u256  // Basis points (e.g., 3000 = 30%)
}

fn process_split_payment(
    splits: Array<PaymentSplit>,
    total_amount: u256
) {
    // Automatically distribute to multiple recipients
}
```

**Frontend:**
- Merchant creates "split groups" (team members + percentages)
- Select split group when generating QR code
- Payment automatically distributed on-chain

**Uniqueness:** Most payment processors don't offer automatic on-chain splitting!

---

### 2. **Dynamic QR Codes (Reusable)** 🔄
Create QR codes that work multiple times for the same amount.

**Use Cases:**
- Coffee shop: "Small Coffee $3" QR code posted at counter
- Parking meters: Fixed rate per hour
- Vending machines: Fixed price items

**Features:**
- Set usage limits (unlimited, 10 uses, etc.)
- Set time limits (valid for 24 hours, 1 week, etc.)
- Track how many times used
- Pause/resume anytime

**Database Schema:**
```javascript
{
  qrType: 'dynamic', // vs 'single-use'
  maxUses: 100,
  currentUses: 47,
  validUntil: Date,
  isActive: true
}
```

**Uniqueness:** Most crypto payment systems only do single-use QR codes!

---

### 3. **Invoice System with Payment Links** 📧
Generate professional invoices with embedded payment links.

**Features:**
- PDF invoice generation
- Email invoices to customers
- Multiple payment options on one invoice
- Partial payment support
- Due date tracking
- Auto-reminder emails

**UI:**

**Uniqueness:** First crypto payment platform with built-in loyalty!

### 5. **Offline Payment Mode** 📴
Accept payments even without internet using QR code signing.

3. Customer signs transaction offline
4. Both sync when back online
5. Payment verified and settled

**Use Cases:**
- Rural areas with poor connectivity
- Events/festivals in remote locations

**Technical:**

    is_active: bool
}
```

**Uniqueness:** Automated recurring crypto payments are rare!
